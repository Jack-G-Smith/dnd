## A Decaying world...
- Gildergleam has long since dried up
- What is causing the decay? Who wants it to succeed? Who wants to stop it?

## Religion
- I think we should try to abandon the concept of religion as anything other than a villainous presence
- Anyone who wields the spells of a cleric or warlock should be portrayed as *unnatural*
    - Crackling smoke, twisting light patterns, destructive
- Deities are just people, long since dead and decayed, worshipped by those looking for power over the hopeless
- Patrons are not deities, but the many faces of an ancient druid, corrupted by power and greed
    - *NOTE: Main hook of a BBEG arc? Destroy each face and the final form will contain the power of all three*

## The Story of Alduin BBEG
- *insert tragic backstory with unforgivable actions here*
    - This needs to really hit home. It will be the backbone of the BBEG's motivation
- Alduin's hunger for power was never satiated, eventually growing so immense that it shattered his very soul
- *Fragments*, small bits of his shattered soul, have been found among the many planes of *Nirn*
    - The cause (and solution) of centuries of strife
    - *NOTE: Use this as your main lore dump on any PC that wants to know more about their new magic item*
    - *NOTE: Also, that makes items not classified as fragments even cooler by comparison*
- Perhaps introduce a corruption mechanic? Meh.
