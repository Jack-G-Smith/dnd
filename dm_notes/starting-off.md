# How to start this:
## Basics
1. Create the group together
1. Backstory really not possible to use properly on its own
1. If you go to the carnival without a ticket, a payment is made 

## The Hook!!!
### Something (or Someone) was taken!
    - The "standard" would be a sibling, but I would *love* other options
        - An older character trying to find a child
        - Looking to revisit a long lost summer fling from 8 years ago
        - Younger orphan looking to find their mother
            - She was captured at this festival 8 years ago! She didn't die!
