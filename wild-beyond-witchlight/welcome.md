# Wild Beyond the Witchlight
Once every eight years, the fantastic Witchlight Carnival touches down on your world, bringing
joy to one settlement after the next. Its owners, Mister Witch and Mister Light, know how to
put on a good show. But there’s more to this
magical extravaganza than meets the eye!

<br /> The carnival is a gateway to a fantastic Feywild domain
unlike anything found on the Material Plane. Time has not
been kind to this realm, however, and dark days lie ahead
unless someone can thwart the dastardly schemes of the
Hourglass Coven.

<br />The Wild Beyond the Witchlight takes adventurers from the
Witchlight Carnival to Prismeer, a Feywild domain of delight.

### Notes from the DM
Just some basic stuff first before getting into the nitty-gritty...
- This may be a pre-written adventure, but it's important to remember that it's also _our_ adventure. That means it's possible (and likely) that we'll have plenty of creative twists and turns along the way - both planned and unplanned. I encourage everyone to engage with the story in creative and fun ways!
- I want to make sure that every player has time to be included in the group. If you feel like you are being left out or you are finding it hard to enjoy yourself, please speak up! <b>I have the most fun doing this when you all are having fun</b>, so I ask that you do your part in addressing anything that hinders  your enjoyment and I'll try to do the same. You can reach out to me in person or just shoot me a text/call and I will do everything in my power to fix it.
### My expectations:
As the DM, I’m going to be putting a lot of time into prepping this adventure for everyone. This will be a commitment. I just have a few expectations for players that will be joining the campaign:
1. Be present during the sessions. (If you’re having trouble with this, let me know if there’s anything that I can do to help). I'm not explicitly banning phones, but I'd really appreciate it if we could all limit their use during sessions.
2. Do not miss more than two sessions every three months. Sessions will be every other Sunday starting at 10:00 am. If you’re going to miss a session, please let me know at least a week in advance.
3. Everyone is inclusive to everyone. If I (or any player) feels uncomfortable, I will do my best to make immediate changes to ensure that does not happen. We are all playing a character, yes, but we are also friends first and foremost. Please remember that.
4. No one should ever tell another player what their character should be doing. This is not a try-hard campaign where your anime waifu gets to kill anyone who gets to make all the decisions and kill those who don't follow their rules. Everyone is here to play their characters as they want to play them. You will need to work as a team, and everyone must be free to make their own choices.
5. Have Fun! The Feywild is a whimsy and wacky place. I’m excited to dive into the "domains of delight" with you all!

**If you feel like you can’t commit to the expectations above, <i>talk to me</i>. We'll figure out what we need to do to make each session fun for everyone.**

## Session Zero
You will not have to prep a character until session zero. I will provide all character sheets and other things for character creation.
### Important Information to Consider
**Feywild Campaign.** The adventure takes place mostly in the feywild. There will be a lot of wilderness exploration.<br /> 
**Level 1-8.** The Adventure starts at 1st and ends as the characters reach 8th level. It will be a good idea to plan on playing characters that are fun at lower levels, instead of ones that aren't as fun until higher levels.<br /> 
**Darkly Whimsical.** The adventure draws from Alice in Wonderland and Brothers Grimm's Fairy Tales. <br /> 
**Roleplay Emphasis.** All encounters within the adventure can be avoided or resolved without resorting to combat.
