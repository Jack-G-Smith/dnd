# The Feywild
The Feywild is a parallel plane to the Material
Plane. Unlike the Material Plane, the Feywild
is fueled by wild, magical energy drawn from
the emotions of its inhabitants. Because of its
connection to the Material Plane, the Feywild
has similar topography and geography to the
mortal world, though exact locations are
constantly shifting and are therefore impossible to plot.

</br> Although the general geography of the Feywild and the
Material Plane is similar, the Feywild has a much more
primal landscape. Nature rules in the lands of fey. Where you
would find sprawling cities in the Material Plane, you might
discover only hunting outposts or desolate ruins in the Plane
of Faeries. Similarly, locations with patches of wilderness in
the mortal realm could be vast, impassable forests in the
Feywild.

This raw, primal magic makes the Feywild an extremely
dangerous place, even for those who call it home.
Adventurers, or those unlucky enough to unwittingly stumble
into this land from the Material Plane, must ensure they are
not lulled into a sense of complacency by the Feywild’s
beauty. The sporadic, magical nature of this land can kill
mortals as quickly as any of its dangerous inhabitants.

### History of the Feywild
The Feywild’s history might be difficult to chart across
editions, but it is known to have the following traits:
- It is a reflection or echo of the Material Plane
- It is readily accessible through ancient or untamed places
- The plane is brimming with powerful, wild magic
- It is neither inherently good or evil, rather it is chaotic neutral
- Time flows strangely when compared to the Material Plane

## Getting to the Feywild
Due to the Feywild’s close relationship with the Material
Plane, crossing between the two is considered so easy that it
is sometimes done by accident.

</br> Fey crossings — areas where the two planes converge — can
be found in ruins and old forests, often changing locations
based on the weather, alignment of the planets, or time of
year. These portals are random enough that unwitting
travelers can stumble across the barrier between the realms
by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. By the time
the hapless traveler realizes that something is amiss, the
portal might disappear, not to return for an hour, a day, or a
century.

</br> While the random convergences of the planes are dangerous
and chaotic, there are areas that act as permanent fey
crossings for the purpose of intentional travel between the
Material Plane and the Feywild. These crossings are usually
well-guarded secrets, as the fey don’t want just anybody to be
given carte blanche access to the powerful magics that reside
in the land of faeries.

## Traveling throughout the Feywild
Whether travelers arrive intentionally or by accident, the
chaotic Plane of Faeries does not show favor or mercy. The
Feywild is deadly, there are no two ways around it. Because
the Feywild has few civilized areas and the roads between
them are unpredictable, traveling from one part of the
Feywild to another is dangerous. Adventurers looking to
move between cities in the Feywild might have to cross
through swamps full of poisonous gas or forests that attempt
to trap travelers in a never-ending maze.

</br>
Even if visitors from the Material Plane manage to survive
the untamed wilderness, innumerable deadly creatures call
the Plane of Faeries home. Because the magic that shapes
the Feywild is more chaotic and powerful than the Material
Plane, even its most common creatures can be infused with
power that can rival hardened adventurers.

</br>Thus, those who journey to the Feywild — whether on
purpose or by chance — must tread carefully, for even the
most innocuous-looking clearing or creature could lead to
their end.

## Features of the Feywild
**Everlasting Twilight.** The sun is ever setting, but never
truly sets or rises. </br>
**Wild and Primal.** Nature in its primordial form; more
vibrant, more alive, more primal. </br>
**Parallel Plane.** An echo of the Material Plane, with
parallel versions of landmarks and terrain features.

## Rules of Conduct
While the fey are focused on the individual self and freedom,
they still hold boundaries and promises. Fey that make pacts
and bargains become magically bound to their promises and
breaking an oath places them under the power of another
creature. To swear an oath or promise favors to another is
reserved for times of desperation or maybe for a desire of
extreme fun.

</br> Furthermore, fey respect traditional laws like how cold iron
can stop them from entering, these boundaries act as walls
and are as binding as shackles. When a fey makes a promise,
they must deliver or face the wrath of those they have
wronged. Likewise, visitors are placed under the same
expectations when it comes to making pacts, even if the
visitor has no idea of the consequences.
- **Rule of Hospitality.** Guests should be treated well until
they prove undeserving.
- **Rule of Ownership.** You must not take anything without
permission.
- **Rule of Reciprocity.** When you receive a gift, you must
accept it and give something equal in value in return
(although not immediately)
